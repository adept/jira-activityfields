This plug-in contains six calculated custom fields:
* Latest comment on the issue
* All issue comments made or updated during the past week
* List of all issues modified during past week (excluding issues with the same type as current)
* List of all issues with due dates during next week (excluding issues with the same type as current)
* List of all issues that are overdue (excluding issues with the same type as current)
* Description of whether any issue in the project is overdue and whether this issue itself is overdue.

This plugin uses JIRA 4.x APIs, so it is not suitable for version 3.13.5 or below.
